## Model qwen3:8b

### 1. Purpose Summary  
The `requirements.txt` file specifies the external libraries required for the **Euler-Maths** repository. These dependencies are essential for numerical computations, data manipulation, and efficient bit-level operations, which are critical for solving mathematical problems (e.g., Project Euler-style challenges).  

---

### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Collaboration  
While the repository's code is not provided, the listed dependencies suggest potential usage patterns:  
- **`numpy`**: Likely used for high-performance numerical computations (e.g., array operations, linear algebra, or statistical calculations).  
- **`bitarray`**: Possibly utilized for efficient bit-level manipulations (e.g., handling binary data, bitmask operations, or memory-optimized storage).  

**Collaboration**:  
- `numpy` and `bitarray` may work together to optimize mathematical algorithms, such as processing large datasets or performing bitwise operations on numerical arrays.  

---

### 3. External Dependencies or APIs Used  
The repository relies on the following external packages:  
- **`numpy`**: A fundamental library for numerical computing in Python.  
- **`bitarray`**: A third-party library for efficient bit-array manipulation (not part of the standard Python library).  

**Installation Note**: These packages must be installed via pip (e.g., `pip install numpy bitarray`) to ensure the repository's mathematical tools function correctly.
