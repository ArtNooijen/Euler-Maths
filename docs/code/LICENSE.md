### 1. Purpose Summary  
The `LICENSE` file in the Euler-Maths repository defines the terms under which the software is distributed. It is an **MIT License** granting users the right to use, modify, distribute, and sublicense the software **free of charge**, provided the original copyright notice and permission notice are included in all copies. The license explicitly disclaims warranties, including merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and excludes liability for any claims arising from the software's use.  

---

### 2. Key Functions/Classes and Their Collaboration  
The `LICENSE` file contains **no code** or executable logic. It is a **textual license agreement** and does not include functions, classes, or collaborative components. The file serves as a legal document rather than a software module.  

---

### 3. External Dependencies or APIs Used  
The `LICENSE` file **does not reference any external dependencies, APIs, or third-party libraries**. It is self-contained and does not rely on external systems or frameworks.  

---

### Notes  
The file is purely a licensing agreement and does not contain any code or executable logic. The repository likely includes mathematical problem-solving code (given the name "Euler-Maths"), but the `LICENSE` file itself is unrelated to code functionality.
